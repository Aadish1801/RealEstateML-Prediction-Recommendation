## Introduction
RealEstateML is designed to predict real estate prices and recommend similar properties based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. The project involves data scraping, preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, model building, and deployment.

## Analytics Module
This module includes various analytical tools to explore and visualize the data:

### Spatial Analysis
Analyze the geographic distribution of properties to understand location-based trends and patterns.

### Price Distribution across Sectors
Visualize how property prices vary across different sectors or neighborhoods.

### Price vs Square Foot Analysis
Examine the relationship between property prices and their sizes in square feet.

### Number of Rooms Pie Chart
Create pie charts to show the distribution of properties based on the number of rooms.

### Top Feature Word Cloud
Generate word clouds to highlight the most frequently mentioned features in property descriptions.

## Price Prediction Module
A machine learning model is developed to predict the prices of properties. Various algorithms are tested and the best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics.

## Recommender System Module
A recommender system is built to suggest similar properties to users based on their preferences and the attributes of the properties.

## Insights Module
This module provides actionable insights derived from the data analysis and model predictions to help users make informed decisions.

## Deployment
The models are deployed using modern deployment techniques to ensure they are accessible and usable. The final models are integrated into a user-friendly web application using Streamlit.
